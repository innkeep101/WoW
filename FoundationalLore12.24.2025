# The Outside Inn: A Lore Foundation

## The Origin

Long before Stormwind rose from stone, the warrior-king **Thoradin** sailed across uncharted seas and landed on a wild shore crawling with spiders. He conquered the forest that would one day be called Elwynn and, on the boundary between the tamed land and the dark unknown, he built **The Outside Inn**—a threshold between worlds.

---

## The Brothers

Thoradin gifted the inn to two brothers, bound by blood but divided by nature:

**Innkept** — A human priest. The Beloved. He tends the hearth, welcomes travelers, and keeps the light burning against the dark. His domain is *inside*—warmth, rest, sanctuary.

**Outkeep** — A worgen rogue. Bloodsail Admiral. Jenkins. He battles a beast within and wants nothing more than to work the bar in peace. But kings keep summoning him, because no lock can hold him and no door can keep him out. His domain is *outside*—shadow, danger, the places others fear to go.

Together, they hold the threshold.

---

## The Outpost

As the human kingdoms warred and unified, The Outside Inn became the rallying point on the edge of civilization—the last fire before the wilderness. Campaigns against spiders, Horde raiders, and nameless horrors all began at its door.

---

## The Destruction

At some point, The Outside Inn fell. The inn that now stands in Goldshire is its successor, but the original's true history has been lost to time and ash.

---

## The Forgotten

**Deadkeep** — A Dark Iron Dwarf Death Knight. Archaeologist. Cryptkeeper. He remembers nothing of his past, only that something pulls him toward the ruins of what once was. Through dust and bone, he digs for answers—his own, and the inn's.

---

## What Remains Unknown

The other keepers—**Zookeep**, **Gearkeep**, **Thornkeep**, **Caskkeep**, **Grimmkeep**, **Bookkeep**, **Nightkeep**, **Scalekeep**, **Brightkeep**, **Spiritkeep**—their connections to The Outside Inn are yet to be discovered. Each carries a title. Each holds a piece of the threshold.

---

## The Threshold

The Outside Inn was never just a building. It was a boundary. Between inside and outside. Known and unknown. Civilization and wilderness. Safety and danger.

That space between? That's where the story lives.

*Details will emerge through gameplay, archaeology, and time. The lore grows as the keepers remember.*
